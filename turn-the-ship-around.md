# Turn the Ship Around!: A True Story of Turning Followers into Leaders 
by L. David Marquet 

## Summary
**Background** Marquet was a submarine captain who was assigned to the worst-performing submarine in the fleet. 
During his first year as captain, he turned the submarine into the best-perfoming submarine in the fleet.
In the book, he shares several stories about how he lead the men and inspired change.

Marquet's Leadership model has three pillars, designed to help turn people into engaged, driven individuals who (can) take the initative to do things.
* **Give control**: Let people have control over how they do their work and their motivations. Let people take responsibility for problems and solutions - rather than them waiting to be told what to do.
* **Mastery**: Help the people develop skills and help them grow as leaders
* **Clarity**: People should understand the bigger picture about the organization's goals, values, and decision-making criteria
